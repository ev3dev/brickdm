Hacking
-------

Get the code:

* Clone of the brickman repo.

        git clone git://github.com/ev3dev/brickman
        cd brickman
        git submodule update --init --recursive

To build for the EV3:

*   Install [Docker] (requires Linux/macOS 10.10.3+/Window 10 Pro)
*   In the source code directory, run the Docker setup script

        ./docker/setup.sh $BUILD_AREA $ARCH

    where `$BUILD_AREA` is any directory you would like. This is where the
    build output will be saved. The directory will be created if it does not
    exist. And `$ARCH` is `armel` (or `armhf` if you are building for RPi
    or BeagleBone).

*   Build the code by running...

        docker exec --tty brickman_armel make install

*   Copy the contents of `$BUILD_AREA/dist/` to the EV3 and run it.

To build the desktop test (makes UI development much faster), in a regular terminal,
not in brickstrap shell:

* Install the build-deps listed in `debian/control` and also the packages
  `libev3devkit-desktop-dev` and `libgtk-3-dev`.
* Then...

        mkdir -p <some-build-dir>
        cd <some-build-dir>
        cmake <path-to-brickman-source> -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=string:Debug -DBRICKMAN_TEST=bool:Yes
        make
        make run

* Also see `brickman.sublime-project` for more build hints.

Note: `brickman.sublime-project` is for [Sublime Text].
